<div id="first-post" class="section level1">
<h1>First post!</h1>
<p>R is turning out to be nicer than I thought! I feel welcomed into R Markdown, <code>dplyr</code>, and friends.</p>
<p>I will have actual content in this post soon, but just to get this far with <code>blogdown</code> is enough for now.</p>
